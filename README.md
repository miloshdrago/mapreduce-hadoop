# MapReduce Implementation
 
This assignment aimed to deliver a Spark implementation to compute San Francisco taxi trips length distribution using geolocation data. Further, it also created an efficient MapReduce application using Hadoop to reconstruct trips from segments and accurately compute airport taxi
trips revenue.

The implementation of MapReduce combined with sanity checks led to a short execution time and a precise revenue computation.
